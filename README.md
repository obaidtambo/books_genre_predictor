 Prediction of Books Genre via its summary.
 
# Overview 
The goal of our project is to predict the genre of the book. For this purpose I am using NLP. We will proceed by doing some exploratory analysis on our dataset and then finally build our model.

Is there any relation of sypnosis of the book with the genre of the book?  How can be predict the genre of book by  using the sypnosis of the book?

## Background and prior work
Text classification is playing a vital role in current era. Its requirement is increasing day by day
because of increase of text data as number of digital users are increasing rapidly. As a result, machine learning algorithms are used to classify certain text data, resulting in better predictions and accuracy. By constructing a data set with proper structure and data, the genre is predicted by the title and summary of the book.  The main focus here was to classify a book by genre using machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
Dataset Name: data.csv

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athu1105/book-genre-prediction

Number of observations: 4657 x 4

Description of the dataset:

* Index - Index of every row.

* Title - Title of the Book .

* Genre - Genre of the Book

* Summary - Synopsis of the Book.

# Conclusion
It has been
seen at places like libraries, book stores and eBook sites where books are not been categorized by its genre. By
revising this point, the main aim here was to classify the books by its genre using machine learning algorithm
and text classification techniques which will help to categorize books by its genre using title and abstract. This
classification can be used in places like libraries, book stores, etc. to organize and categorize books as per there
requirement. Our model can predict the genre of the book with good accuracy. However the accuracy can be increased with a greater number of complex and unstructured data with
proper use of new classification techniques and algorithms.
